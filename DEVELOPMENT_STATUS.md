# Development Status Report

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure
- ✅ Complete repository structure with all required directories
- ✅ README.md with Persian documentation and setup instructions
- ✅ .gitignore for Node.js/Playwright projects
- ✅ package.json with all necessary dependencies and scripts

### 2. Environment Configuration
- ✅ .env.example with all required variables
- ✅ Updated README with environment documentation
- ✅ Secure credential handling (no hardcoded values)

### 3. Data Collection (Collector)
- ✅ Playwright-based collector for QXBroker login and chart access
- ✅ Chart screenshot capture functionality
- ✅ Candle data extraction from DOM (placeholder implementation)
- ✅ JSON data storage in artifacts directory

### 4. Strategy Module
- ✅ Complete implementation of Steve Nison's Japanese candlestick patterns:
  - Bullish/Bearish Engulfing
  - Hammer and Shooting Star
  - Morning Star and Evening Star
  - Doji detection
- ✅ Trend analysis with moving averages
- ✅ Multi-timeframe confirmation (5m entry + 10m trend)
- ✅ Signal generation with confirmation factors

### 5. Backtest Module
- ✅ Historical data backtesting engine
- ✅ Trade simulation for binary options
- ✅ Performance metrics calculation (win rate, ROI, drawdown)
- ✅ HTML report generation in Persian
- ✅ JSON results export

### 6. Telegram Integration
- ✅ Persian message formatting
- ✅ Image attachment support
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Environment-based configuration

### 7. Testing Framework
- ✅ Unit tests for strategy module (12 tests passing)
- ✅ Unit tests for Telegram sender
- ✅ Backtest validation tests
- ✅ Mock data generation for testing

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Node.js setup with caching
- ✅ Playwright browser installation
- ✅ Test execution and artifact collection

### 9. Deployment Infrastructure
- ✅ PM2 ecosystem configuration
- ✅ Health check monitoring system
- ✅ Deployment script with validation
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

### 10. Main Bot Application
- ✅ Complete bot entry point
- ✅ Multi-symbol monitoring
- ✅ Signal generation and validation
- ✅ Duplicate signal prevention
- ✅ Logging and error handling

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. Playwright Browser Installation
- **Status**: Pending due to disk space constraints
- **Impact**: Cannot test live data collection
- **Solution**: Free up disk space and run `npx playwright install`

### 2. QXBroker Integration
- **Status**: Placeholder implementation
- **Impact**: Needs actual DOM selectors and API integration
- **Solution**: Manual inspection of QXBroker's chart implementation

### 3. Symbol Mapping
- **Status**: Basic implementation
- **Impact**: May need broker-specific symbol mapping
- **Solution**: Research QXBroker's symbol naming convention

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (After Disk Space Fix)
1. Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
2. Test collector with real QXBroker credentials
3. Refine DOM selectors for actual chart data extraction
4. Test Telegram integration with real bot

### Short Term
1. Implement real-time candle data extraction
2. Add more candlestick patterns from Nison's book
3. Enhance confirmation factors (volume, support/resistance)
4. Add more comprehensive backtesting

### Medium Term
1. Deploy to production server
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Implement performance analytics
4. Add more currency pairs and timeframes

## 📊 Test Results

### Strategy Tests: ✅ 12/12 PASSING
- Candlestick pattern detection
- Trend analysis
- Signal generation
- Data normalization

### Backtest Tests: ✅ WORKING
- Historical data processing
- Trade simulation
- Metrics calculation
- Report generation

### Integration Tests: ⏳ PENDING
- Live data collection (requires Playwright)
- Telegram message sending (requires credentials)
- Full bot execution (requires both above)
